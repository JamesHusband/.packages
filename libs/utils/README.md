## Utils Library

The Utils library provides domain-agnostic utilities, streamlining code reuse and efficiency across the monorepo with a comprehensive suite of common functions and helpers.

### Core Responsibilities

- **Code Reusability**: Facilitates the sharing of utility functions, reducing code duplication.
- **Efficiency**: Provides optimized utility functions, enabling developers to concentrate on unique business requirements.
- **Maintainability**: Ensures easy updates and maintenance through a single source of utilities, enhancing project consistency and quality.

! Is this code truly generic, or should it be further refactored??
