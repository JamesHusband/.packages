Caching Mechanism:

Implement a caching layer for GET requests to improve performance and reduce the load on the server. This can be particularly useful for data that doesn't change often.
Retry Logic:

Integrate automatic retry logic for idempotent requests that fail due to transient errors (like network issues). Consider using exponential backoff for retry delays.
Rate Limiting:

If your application makes numerous API calls, consider adding rate limiting to avoid hitting API limits or overwhelming the server.
Request Throttling:

Implement throttling to control the number of requests sent to the server within a certain timeframe, enhancing the stability of your application under load.
Environment-Specific Configuration:

Support for loading different configurations based on the environment (development, staging, production) can help manage API endpoints, timeouts, and other settings more efficiently.
Request Validation:

Validate outgoing request data against predefined schemas to catch errors early and ensure data integrity.
Enhanced Error Handling:

Expand the error handling mechanism to classify errors (client errors, server errors, network errors) and handle them accordingly. Provide more detailed error logs or messages for debugging purposes.
Unit Tests and Mocks:

Continue expanding unit tests to cover edge cases, error scenarios, and retry logic. Ensure mocks accurately reflect the behavior of dependencies for more reliable tests.
Documentation:

Comprehensive documentation covering how to use the library, configuration options, and examples of common use cases can greatly improve the developer experience.
TypeScript Definitions:

If not already complete, ensure all functions, classes, and interfaces are well-typed to leverage TypeScript's full potential for error checking and developer tooling.
Observability:

Integrate with observability tools for monitoring, tracing, and logging HTTP requests and responses, providing insights into API performance and issues.
Security:

Ensure that security best practices are followed, particularly in handling sensitive information in requests and responses. Consider integrating security headers, tokens, and other mechanisms as part of the request configuration.
