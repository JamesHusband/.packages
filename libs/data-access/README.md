## Data Access Library

This library centralizes and simplifies data interactions within a monorepo, providing a consistent and secure way to perform CRUD operations for both API and database interactions across applications.

### Core Responsibilities

- **Unified Interface**: Facilitates CRUD operations for interacting with APIs and databases, offering a consistent approach across the board.
- **Consistency & Integrity**: Ensures data handling is uniform and maintains integrity throughout the application lifecycle.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implements caching and query optimizations to enhance application performance.
- **Security Measures**: Enforces robust security protocols to protect data access and transactions.
