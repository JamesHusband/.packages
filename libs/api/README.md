## API Library

The API library offers streamlined endpoints for external APIs, facilitating communication between the application's data layer and external services. It encapsulates the logic for making requests to various data sources, ensuring efficient and organized access to external data.

### Core Responsibilities

- **Endpoint Management**: Centralizes the creation and management of endpoints for external API interactions.
- **Data Layer Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the data layer, abstracting the complexities of data communication and manipulation.
- **Efficiency & Organization**: Enhances the efficiency of external data access and ensures organized, maintainable code for API interactions.
